I’m a 17 years old pixel artist from Vietnam. I’ve been doing pixel art for over a year now, everything from banners and wallpapers to profile pictures and more.

I’ve also been making Minecraft texture packs for over three years, and I share a lot of my work on my YouTube with 600+ subscribers.

Currently open for pixel art commissions, feel free to reach out if you’re interested!
